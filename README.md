# Human-Computer-Interaction-Armband

__Description:__

An armband that tracks changes in forearm position and movement as well as changes in the electrical activity of forearm muscles to control devices. 
This is a repository related to the programming work I did for my final year project from my university days. 

_NOTE: Detailed description of each individual application (tools used, description, etc) in this project is written in the sub directories. 
As writing all that information here would make this README file convoluted._
