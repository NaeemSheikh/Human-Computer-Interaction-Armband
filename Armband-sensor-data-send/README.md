# HCI Armband Sensors Data

__Tools Used:__

* Arduino Uno
* HC-05
* EMG amplifier circuit
* MPU6050

__Description:__

This is the main central application of this project. The program behind the HCI Armband, it collects the data from the connected sensors and sends them wirelessly via the HC-05 bluetooth module to the device we want to control with this armband.
This program sends the EMG amplitude, and the relevant data from the MPU6050 IMU.
