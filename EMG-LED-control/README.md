# Toggle LED ON/OFF Using An EMG Amplifier Circuit

__Tools Used:__

* Arduino Uno
* EMG Amplifier circuit
* LED

__Description:__

This program uses the Arduino board to take the incoming EMG signals from the EMG amplifier circuit, and use the EMG signal to control the LED power state. If the EMG signal is above the minimum set threshold, the LED power state is toggled between ON and OFF.
